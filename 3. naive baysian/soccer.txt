Playing with 10 men for most of the game, Brazil held the Ivory Coast to a 0-0 draw
on Sunday in the group stage of the men&#39;s Olympic football tournament.
Brazil are the defending Olympic champion after winning on home soil at the 2016
Rio de Janeiro Games. But the Brazilians were at a disadvantage early when Douglas
Luiz, who plays for Aston Villa, was sent off in the 13th minute.
