TOKYO â€” It&#39;s a stunning upset for the world&#39;s top-ranked female tennis player.
Australia&#39;s Ash Barty was a favorite to win gold in women&#39;s singles tennis.
But underdog Sara Sorribes Tormo, from Spain, beat her in straight sets in the first
round of Olympic competition in Tokyo.
Barty won Wimbledon just two weeks ago.
